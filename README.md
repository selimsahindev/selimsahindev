Hello there! 👋
---

I'm passionate about web architectures, and I'm currently striving to showcase my strengths as a backend developer.

My go-to technologies for projects include **`.Net Core`**, **`Laravel`**, and **`Node.js`**.

In addition to my proficiency in backend development, I have a fondness for containerization technologies. I've embraced the power of **`Docker`** and **`Kubernetes`** to streamline deployment processes. Exploring the cloud, I also dabble in **`AWS`** to enhance my skill set.

As a hobby, I delve into the exciting world of game development. It's not just about code for me; it's about creating immersive and enjoyable experiences.

Let's code something extraordinary together! 🌐✨
