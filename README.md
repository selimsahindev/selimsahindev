About me
---

I'm passionate about web architectures and currently striving to showcase my strengths as a backend developer.

My go-to technologies for projects include **`Spring Boot`** and **`Node.js`**.

In addition to that, I have a fondness for containerization technologies. I've embraced the power of **`Docker`** and **`Kubernetes`** to streamline deployment processes. I also dabble in **`AWS`** to enhance my cloud knowledge.

As a hobby, I delve into the exciting world of game development. It's not just about code for me; it's about creating immersive and enjoyable experiences.

Let's code something extraordinary together! üåê‚ú®
